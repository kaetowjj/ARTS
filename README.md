# ARTS
In response to the activities of 左耳朵耗子: Complete at least one LeetCode algorithm problem per week, read and review at least one English technical article, learn at least one technical skill, and share at least one technical article with viewpoints and reflections. Persist for at least one year! (Also known as: Algorithm, Review, Technique, Share, abbreviated as ARTS)

响应左耳朵耗子的活动：每周至少做一个leetcode 的算法题， 阅读并点评至少一篇英文技术文章， 学习至少一个技术技巧， 至少分享一篇有观点和思考的技术文章。 坚持至少一年！ （也就是：Algorithm、Review、Technique、Share 简称ARTS）

# The Original Intention of ARTS
# ARTS的初衷
## Algorithm
Mainly for programming training and learning. Complete at least one LeetCode algorithm problem per week (start with Easy, then Medium, and finally Hard). Programming training is necessary because no matter how many algorithm books you read, you still won't be able to solve algorithm problems without practice. Regarding the advantages of doing LeetCode, you can read my article on CoolShell, titled "LeetCode Programming Training - CoolShell."

主要是为了编程训练和学习。每周至少做一个 leetcode 的算法题（先从Easy开始，然后再Medium，最后才Hard）。进行编程训练，如果不训练你看再多的算法书，你依然不会做算法题，看完书后，你需要训练。关于做Leetcode的的优势，你可以看一下我在coolshell上的文章 Leetcode 编程训练 - 酷 壳 - CoolShell。

## Review
Mainly for learning English. If your English is not good, you will hardly become a technical expert. So, you need to read and review at least one English technical article. My personal favorite places to go are http://Medium.com (requires a VPN) and various company technical blogs, such as Netflix's.

主要是为了学习英文，如果你的英文不行，你基本上无缘技术高手。所以，需要你阅读并点评至少一篇英文技术文章，我个人最喜欢去的地方是http://Medium.com（需要梯子）以及各个公司的技术blog，如Netflix的。

## Tip
Mainly for summarizing and consolidating the knowledge points encountered in your daily work. Learn at least one technical skill. Document the problems you encountered, the pitfalls you've encountered, and the bits of knowledge you've learned.

主要是为了总结和归纳你在是常工作中所遇到的知识点。学习至少一个技术技巧。你在工作中遇到的问题，踩过的坑，学习的点滴知识。

## Share
Mainly for establishing your influence and being able to contribute valuable insights. Share a technical article with viewpoints and reflections.

主要是为了建立你的影响力，能够输出价值观。分享一篇有观点和思考的技术文章。
